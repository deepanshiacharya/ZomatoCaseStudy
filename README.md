# Decoding-India-s-Changing-Palate-A-Visual-Analysis-of-Food-Delivery-and-Consumption-Patterns

## Introduction
Project Goals:
 1. To visually explore the trend of increasing expenditure on processed and 
ready-to-eat food in India.//
2. To understand the role of food delivery platforms like Zomato in this trend, 
particularly in urban areas.//
3. To identify patterns in Zomato order data related to food preferences and 
location.// 
4. To contextualize the rise of food delivery within broader economic and 
consumption trends in India.
## Narrative:
The growing spending on processed and ready-to-eat food in India is primarily 
driven by rising disposable incomes and changing urban lifestyles, rather than 
solely by the emergence of food delivery platforms like Zomato. As economic 
growth expands financial flexibility for a larger segment of the population—
particularly in urban areas—people are increasingly willing to spend on Decoding India's Changing Palate: A Visual Analysis of Food Delivery and Consumption Patterns1
convenience-oriented food options. Moreover, time constraints resulting from 
longer work hours, traffic congestion, and busy schedules have reduced the 
inclination and capacity for home-cooked meals. In this evolving landscape, 
Zomato acts as a powerful enabler, enhancing access to a wide variety of 
restaurant food at the tap of a button. It has reinforced and accelerated the shift 
toward convenient and time-saving meal solutions. However, while Zomato plays a 
crucial role in shaping consumption patterns, the underlying transformation is 
rooted in broader socioeconomic and lifestyle changes that were already 
underway.
## Context and Problem Statement
### Background: Shifting Food Consumption Trends in an Urbanizing India
India is undergoing rapid urbanization, with a significant portion of its population 
migrating to cities in search of economic opportunities and improved lifestyles. 
This increasing urbanization has profoundly impacted traditional food 
consumption patterns. Urban environments often present individuals with busier 
schedules, longer commutes, and a greater exposure to diverse culinary options. 
Consequently, there's a growing demand for convenience and readily available 
food choices that fit these evolving lifestyles. This shift is not limited to just ease 
of access but also encompasses a desire for variety and the experience of 
restaurant-quality food without the constraints of cooking at home. Furthermore, 
globalized food trends and increased exposure to different cuisines through media 
and travel have also contributed to a diversification of Indian palates.
### Personal Observation and Broader Context
My own experience of increased reliance on Zomato for meals  after relocating to 
a busy city initially sparked my curiosity about how such platforms influence our 
food choices. While this shift highlighted the ease and convenience they offer, it 
also made me wonder whether my experience was unique or part of a broader 
pattern. This curiosity led me to examine national-level food consumption data to 
better understand the larger impact of platforms like Zomato.→
### National Trend: The Growing Preference for Processed Foods
Data from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey reveals a significant 
national trend: an increasing share of household expenditure is being directed Decoding India's Changing Palate: A Visual Analysis of Food Delivery and Consumption Patterns2
towards processed and ready-to-eat food items. This share rose from 
approximately 18% in 201112 to around 25% in 202223. This indicates a broader 
societal shift in food consumption habits, suggesting a growing acceptance and 
preference for convenient food options that require less preparation time. While 
this shift in food consumption was well underway even prior to the widespread 
use of food delivery platforms, their emergence has likely accelerated this trend.→ Problem Statement:
The project aims to delve deeper into the relationship between the rise of food 
delivery platforms, exemplified by Zomato, and the increasing consumption of 
processed and ready-to-eat food in urban India. While convenience offered by 
these platforms is a clear factor, our analysis seeks to explore the underlying 
drivers and patterns associated with this shift.
