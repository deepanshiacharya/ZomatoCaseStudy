# ZomatoCaseStudy

This project explores how rising disposable incomes and changing urban lifestyles in India influence food consumption patterns, with a focus on the role of food delivery platforms like Zomato. By combining Zomato restaurant data with national economic and food consumption datasets, we identify trends in processed food preferences and their socioeconomic drivers.

**Project goal :**
1. Visually explore the trend of increasing expenditure on processed and ready-to-eat food in India.
2. Understand Zomato’s role in urban food consumption patterns.
3. Identify location-based preferences and restaurant density insights in major Indian cities.
4. Contextualize food delivery growth alongside broader economic trends.

**Datasets Used :**

Urban vs Rural Consumption: Urban processed food expenditure rose from 11% (2004–05) to nearly 29% (2023–24), while rural areas showed slower growth.
GDP Impact: Rising GDP per capita closely correlates with increased processed food consumption and Zomato sales.

**Tools & Technologies**
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,plotly)
Tableau (for interactive visualizations)

**Conclusion**
The analysis confirms:
Processed and ready-to-eat food consumption in India is rising, driven more by increasing disposable incomes and urban lifestyles than just food delivery platforms.
Zomato acts as an enabler and accelerator rather than the root cause.
Urban areas show a sharper shift compared to rural regions in food consumption patterns.
