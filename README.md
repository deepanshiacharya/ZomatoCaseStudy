# India’s Food Consumption Shift: A Data-Driven Analysis of Food Delivery Trends
Project Overview
This project explores how rising disposable incomes and changing urban lifestyles in India influence food consumption patterns, focusing on the role of food delivery platforms like Zomato. It combines Zomato restaurant data with national economic and food consumption datasets to uncover patterns in processed food preferences and their socioeconomic drivers.

## Project Goals
Analyze the growing expenditure on processed and ready-to-eat food in India using visual and data-driven methods.
Understand Zomato’s role in shaping urban food consumption behavior.
Identify location-based food preferences and restaurant distribution patterns across major Indian cities.
Contextualize the rise of food delivery services within broader economic and lifestyle shifts.

## Narrative Summary
India’s increasing reliance on processed and ready-to-eat food is primarily driven by rising disposable incomes and evolving urban lifestyles. Platforms like Zomato act as key enablers, enhancing accessibility but not being the sole drivers of this transformation.

## Key observations:
Time-constrained urban lifestyles are reducing home-cooked meal preferences.
Zomato and similar platforms simplify access to restaurant-quality food, accelerating existing trends.
Broader socioeconomic changes—such as urbanization and income growth—are the fundamental drivers.

## Context and Problem Statement
Background:
India is experiencing rapid urbanization, profoundly impacting food consumption patterns. Urban dwellers increasingly prefer convenience-based eating habits, supported by the growing availability of food delivery services.

## National Trend:
HCES data indicates a significant national shift:
Processed food expenditure rose from ~18% (2011–12) to ~25% (2022–23) in urban households.

## Problem Statement:
The project aims to investigate the link between food delivery platform growth and rising processed food consumption in urban India, uncovering deeper behavioral and economic drivers behind this shift.

## Datasets Used

## Analysis Highlights
Urban Processed Food Spending:
Increased from ~11% (2004–05) to ~29% (2023–24) — showing clear urban behavior shifts.
Word Clouds:
Highlighting popular processed foods like pizza, biryani, fried chicken in Bangalore, Mumbai, Kolkata.
Restaurant Density:
High concentration of restaurants in specific urban localities indicates demand for convenience.
Zomato vs. Swiggy Financial Growth:
Zomato leads in both Gross Order Value and Monthly Transacting Users between 2021–2025.
GDP Correlation:
As India’s GDP per capita increased, so did processed food expenditure and food delivery platform growth.

## Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Tableau 

## Key Takeaways
Urban food consumption patterns in India are increasingly convenience-driven.
Zomato and similar platforms accelerate but do not cause this shift—economic growth is the primary driver.
The analysis provides actionable insights for category management, growth strategy, and monetization in e-commerce and food delivery sectors.
